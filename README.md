# Turbofan Engine Remaining Useful Life Prediction (FD001)

> *Reliability Engineering & Machine Learning*

---

# 1. Project Overview

Predict the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of turbofan engines from the NASA C-MAPSS dataset using a hybrid:
- **Reliability modeling** (Weibull distribution, Mean Residual Life)
- **Machine Learning** (Random-Forest and XGBoost regressors)

This enables **predictive maintenance** before failure.

# 3. Problem Formulation

**Given:** noisy sensor streams from multiple engines until failure.

**Predict:** Remaining Useful Life (RUL) â€” cycles left until failure â€” for each engine in the test set.

---

# 4. Workflow Summary

### Step 1: Understand degradation patterns
- Sensor data shows small drifts masked by noise.
- Lifetime varies between ~130â€“350 cycles.

### Step 2: Model reliability baseline
- Fit a two-parameter **Weibull** distribution to engine lifetimes.
- Compute **Mean Residual Life** \( L(t) \) for each engine based on its age.

**Weibull Survivor Function:**

$$
S(t) = e^{ -(\frac{t}{\lambda})^\kappa}
$$

---

**Mean Residual Life (MRL) Function:**

$$
L(t) = \frac{\int_t^\infty S(u) \, du}{S(t)} - t
$$

### Step 3: Engineer rolling features
- For each sensor: moving averages, minima, maxima, standard deviations (5 and 30-cycle windows).
- Add age, settings, and Weibull MRL as input features.

### Step 4: Machine learning models
- Train a **Random-Forest** and an **XGBoost** regressor on the feature matrix.
- Tune hyperparameters lightly (n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate).

### Step 5: Evaluation
- Metrics:
  - **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
  - **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error
  - **PHM08 Score**: Penalty-heavy metric from the PHM 2008 Challenge




# 5. Key Figures (Detailed)

### **A) Lifetime distribution**

![](reports/figures/lifetime_hist.png)

**What it shows:**
- Number of engines surviving to different lifetimes.
- Peak around 170â€“220 cycles.

**Why it matters:**
- Sets the scale of typical engine life.
- Shows natural variation and motivates statistical modeling.

**Decision:**
âœ… Expect failure most commonly between 170â€“220 cycles.

---

### **B) Sensor drift examples**

![](reports/figures/sensor_traces.png)

**What it shows:**
- Sensor readings for three engines over their lifetime.

**Why it matters:**
- Shows subtle, noisy drifts in sensor values.
- Indicates need for rolling/statistical feature engineering.

**Decision:**
âœ… Engineer moving averages, maxima, minima.

---

### **C) Survivor curve: Weibull vs Kaplan-Meier**

![](reports/figures/survivor_fit.png)

**What it shows:**
- Fitted Weibull survival curve over empirical survival curve.

**Why it matters:**
- Shows Weibull fits reasonably well â€” imperfect but strong starting point.

**Decision:**
âœ… Use Weibull \( S(t) \) and derive \( L(t) \) for modeling and features.

---

### **D) Mean Residual Life (MRL) curve**

![](reports/figures/mrl_curve.png)

**What it shows:**
- Expected remaining life based on engine age.

**Why it matters:**
- Natural decline; strong scalar feature indicating health.

**Decision:**
âœ… Include Weibull MRL as a major feature in ML models.

---

### **E) Random-Forest feature importances**

![](reports/figures/rf_feat_imp.png)

**What it shows:**
- Top 15 most impactful features.

**Why it matters:**
- Confirms that MRL and engineered rolling sensor features dominate.

**Decision:**
âœ… Trust feature engineering pipeline.

---

### **F) RF test-set residuals**

![](reports/figures/err_hist.png)

**What it shows:**
- Histogram of prediction errors.

**Why it matters:**
- Errors are centered and symmetric; no large systematic bias.

**Decision:**
âœ… RF model is acceptable and reliable.
